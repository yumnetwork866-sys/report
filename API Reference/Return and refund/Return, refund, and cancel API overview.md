# Context
Cancel/Return/Refund, also referred to as 'post-transaction' or 'after-sales' can be initiated by a buyer or directly processed by a seller. TikTok Shop provides two APIs for sellers process these after-sales situations. The cancel API allows sellers to process a buyer order cancellation request as well as a direct seller order cancellation. The return API allows sellers to process a buyer order refund/ return & refund request. For situations where TikTok Shop cancels/ refunds an order, please refer to TikTok Shop Seller Academy for details.
<br>
Cancel order: Order cancellations can be initiated by a buyer after the buyer remorse window or directly canceled by the seller. For each canceled order, there is a buyer/seller cancel reason, cancel status, cancel order creation time, and the seller's process time for the buyer cancellation request. In the US and UK markets, TikTok Shop allows sellers to process partial order cancellations on item out of stock scenario.
<br>
Return order: Return orders refers to when a buyer requests to return or refund one or more items from an order. Returns can be initiated by a buyer after they have received the items. Return orders contain the buyer/seller return or refund reason, return/refund status, return or refund request time, the seller's process time for the buyer return/refund request, and the refund amount.
<br>

## Cancel/Return/Refund initiator explanation

* BUYER: The buyer that placed the order.
* SELLER: TikTok Shop seller.
* SYSTEM: Orders may be cancelled by the TikTok Shop system automatically based on TikTok Shop's policies. For example, this can happen if a package is lost in transit, and TikTok Shop detects that the tracking number has not changed for over 7 days.
* OPERATOR: Orders may also be cancelled by TikTok Shop's customer service for a variety of reasons. 


## Cancel
**Order Cancellations:** This API allows sellers to cancel paid orders as well as manage order cancellation requests. Please note, only orders that have not yet been shipped can be canceled.
<br>
Note: Buyers cannot cancel individual line items within multiple line item orders. Currently, only US and UK sellers are allowed to do partial cancel on item out of stock scenario.
<br>
**Cancel Types:** On the TikTok Shop platform, there are two types of order cancellations on TikTok Shop: buyer initiated cancellation, i.e. BUYER_CANCEL and direct cancellation, i.e. CANCEL. Seller/System/Operator can direct cancel an order. BUYER_CANCEL requires the seller to review the cancellation request. If an order's status is 'ON_HOLD', and a buyer initiates a cancellation, TikTok Shop will accept the cancellation request on behalf of the seller automatically. The seller does not need to review the cancellation request. In this case, this order will have a 'CANCEL' cancellation type.
<br>
**Cancellation Reasons:** Please refer to [our list of cancel reasons](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/docv2/page/67e61eee427345048595487d#Back%20To%20Top).

> **Note**: If the buyer cancellation request is made **before** the 2-business day Standard Shipping SLA from the order date, the seller must act within 24 hours. If no action is taken, TikTok Shop will auto-approve the cancellation and issue a refund. Sellers must resolve the request by either:

>    * Uploading the tracking number to the cancellation request
>    * Approving the cancellation

> Shipping the item or taking no other action will result in the cancellation being approved.
> 
> **Note**: If the cancellation request is made **after** the 2-business-day Standard Shipping SLA from the order date, but before the order is marked as **"In transit"**, TikTok Shop will automatically approve the cancellation and issue a refund.

>    * For more information on SLAs, refer to the [Fulfillment Policy](https://seller-us.tiktok.com/university/essay?identity=1&role=1&knowledge_id=3995852763301633&from=policy).

**Business Case:**

* Buyer initiates a return request

* Seller initiates a return

![Image](https://p16-arcosite-sg.ibyteimg.com/tos-alisg-i-k9wyc2ijk0-sg/1e501178d5724395ad1e5b2071e6c1ca~tplv-k9wyc2ijk0-image.image)

## **Batch Return:**
**Background:** Batch Return is a Return sub-scenario where a buyer orders multiple SKUs and submits one return request in TikTok App. The buyer expects one return journey and one shipping label/QR, while downstream seller systems usually expect one RMA containing all expected line items.
The legacy behavior can decouple unique `sku_id` values into separate `return_id` / RMA records. That breaks return-platform, OMS, WMS, and warehouse operations that need one unified record.
| Object | Purpose | Key seller action | Key identifier |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Aftersales Request | Buyer-facing request object that groups all requested SKUs and quantities for one batch return. | First review at line-item level. | `aftersales_request_id` |
| RMA (package-level return order) | Logistics-executable object created from approved items after package split. | Upload shipping information and complete second review per package. | `rma_id` |

**Business Flow:**

**Business Case:**

* Buyer initiates a return request

![Image](https://p16-arcosite-sg.ibyteimg.com/tos-alisg-i-k9wyc2ijk0-sg/f7069924fdcc4e169d55daa748b072c5~tplv-k9wyc2ijk0-image.image)
**New Webhooks:**
| Webhook | Example status | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AFTERSALES_REQUEST_STATUS_UPDATE` | `PENDING_REQUEST_REVIEW`, `REQUEST_REVIEW_COMPLETED` | Signals request-level lifecycle and first-review completion |
| `RMA_STATUS_UPDATE` | `RMA_CREATED` | Signals unified RMA creation for second-review / warehouse workflow |
| `REFUND_SUCCESS` | `REFUND_SUCCESS` | Signals refund success for a given sku. |
#### New / Key API Surface
| API | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/return_refund/{api_version}/aftersales/search` | Search Aftersales Request | Retrieve unified request using `aftersales_request_id` |
| `/return_refund/{api_version}/rma/search` | Search RMA Requests | Retrieve unified RMA with line-level return details |
| `/return_refund/{api_version}/aftersales/review` | Review Aftersales / RMA | Supports `request_id_type = AFTERSALES` and `request_id_type = RMA` |
| Search Aftersales Request API | First-review data fetch | Exposes all return line item IDs for the unified request |
| Search RMA Requests API | Second-review data fetch | Used after `RMA_CREATED` to sync OMS/WMS |
| Upload Shipping Document API | Label / QR upload | Used by ISV / return platform when TikTok must show buyer the label/QR |
#### Review Decision Model
| Review phase | `request_id_type` | Example decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st Review | `AFTERSALES` | Approve or reject the return request |
| 2nd Review | `RMA` | `APPROVE_RETURN_PACKAGE`, `REJECT_RETURN_PACKAGE`, or mixed line-level decision |

Line-level decisions are a major improvement: sellers can approve some returned line items and reject others based on warehouse grading. The ARD notes an MVP limitation for same-SKU split decisions; Phase 2 expands support.
## Replacement

## Cancel/Return/Refund Initiative Policy
**Policy for Initiating Cancellations**
Buyers

* Buyers can freely cancel unpaid orders.

<br>
For the UK, TikTok Shop uses the ON_HOLD status to define an order that's within the buyer remorse window. If a buyer requests an order cancellation while the order has an ON_HOLD status, TikTok Shop will automatically accept the buyer cancellation request on behalf of the seller. For regions outside of the UK, the buyer remorse window starts when the order changes to AWAITING_SHIPMENT status +1 hour. The buyer will no longer be able to request for cancellations if the seller has fulfilled the order.
<br>

* Orders that are outside of the buyer remorse window

Once an order is longer within the buyer remorse window, the cancellation must be reviewed by the seller. If an order status changes to AWAITING_COLLECTION, the buyer will no longer be able to request for a cancellation.
<br>
Sellers

* Seller cannot cancel unpaid orders.
* Seller can cancel orders with the following statuses: 'ON_HOLD', 'AWAITING_SHIPMENT' and 'AWAITING_COLLECTION'.

<br>
For more details, please refer to Seller Academy.

**Policy for Initiating Refunds**

* Sellers are allowed to initiate refund requests when the order status is 'DELIVERED'

<br>

**Policy for Initiating Returns**

# Frequently Asked Questions

* Can a seller issue a partial refund to the buyer?
   * Different markets have different policies. Please refer to Seller Academy for details.

<br>

* What is the difference between cancel and refund?

If the package is still being delivered and the buyer insists on canceling the order, the seller should ask the buyer to initiate a refund request.

<br>

* If a seller initiates a refund, are there any additional approvals needed?
   * No. TikTok Shop will automatically refund the buyer.
